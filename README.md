# Typing test

Try it—and check your typing speed (in chars per minute) and accuracy!

[Working version](https://Gina-K.github.io/typing_test)

*Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

## How to use

Begin typing the text—and all will start automatically:)

Pay attention: test is case-sensitive.

Speed and accuracy are calculating in real time, and you could type all the text or stop at any time and just find out
the results.

Hope you'll have some fun! :)
